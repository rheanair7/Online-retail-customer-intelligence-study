# Online Retail Customer Intelligence Study

This repository contains a **collaborative group project** focused on building a comprehensive customer intelligence study for a UK-based online giftware retailer. The project was developed as part of our academic coursework and reflects contributions from all team members.



## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze customer transaction data to:
- Describe current business performance
- Diagnose underlying causes
- Prescribe actionable strategies
- Predict future outcomes

The company specializes in selling unique, all-occasion giftware to wholesale buyers across multiple countries.



## Key Strategic Questions
- What products should be sold to which countries and during which time periods to maximize sales?
- How do customer behaviors vary by region, season, and product type?
- Which products are often purchased together, and how can this support effective bundling strategies?
- How can we better understand and serve different customer segments based on their value contribution?



## Dataset

We used the [Online Retail II dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
It includes transactional data from December 1, 2009, to December 9, 2011, from a UK-based non-store online retailer.


## Analytical Approaches & Deliverables

- **Customer Segmentation & Marketing**  
  Using **RFM Analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to segment customers into categories such as *Champions* and *At Risk*, enabling targeted marketing strategies.

- **Sales & Product Strategy**  
  Implemented **Association Rule Mining (Apriori algorithm)** to identify product combinations frequently bought together, informing bundling and cross-sell opportunities.

- **Geographical Targeting**  
  Analyzed purchasing patterns by country to guide regional marketing and product focus.

- **Demand Forecasting**  
  Applied **Holt-Winters exponential smoothing** to forecast sales trends by product and geography, aiding in inventory and promotion planning.

- **Inventory Optimization**  
  Assessed seasonal demand patterns to reduce holding costs and prevent stockouts.

- **Customer Lifecycle Management**  
  Tracked engagement changes over time to support retention strategies using personalized offers.

- **Strategic Reporting**  
  Developed **interactive Tableau dashboards** for clear, visual reporting of key metrics and customer behavior insights.
